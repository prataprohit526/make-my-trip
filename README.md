-   It can be time-consuming activity while browsing through different airlines, hotels, resorts, etc, to find the best deals and prices. Applications like MakeMyTrip, Kayak, booking.com, etc provide features like quick and easy comparison of not just fares but schedules on many different airlines at a glance, flexible date searches, and multi-airline itineraries, which have really made this experience less time-consuming.

-   Through this project, I explore the concepts of Javascript, Sass, React, Firebase, Node, Express, MongoDB.
